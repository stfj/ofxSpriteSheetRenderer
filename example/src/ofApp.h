1,	/* .height			(int) - the height of each animation frame in tiles																									*/
75,	/* .frameduration	(unsigned int) - how many milliseconds each frame should be on screen. Less = faster																*/
0,	/* .nexttick		(unsigned int) - the next time the frame should change. based on frame duration. This is an internal variable and should always be set to 0 at init	*/
-1,	/* .loops			(int) - the number of loops to run. -1 equals infinite. This can be adjusted at runtime to pause animations, etc.									*/
-1,	/* .finalindex		(int) - the index of the final tile to draw when the animation finishes. -1 is the default so total_frames-1 will be the last frame.				*/
1	/* .frameskip		(int) - the incrementation of each frame. 1 should be set by default. If you wanted the animation to play backwards you could set this to -1, etc.	*/
